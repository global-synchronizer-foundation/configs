## Voting Duration for MainNet, DevNet, and TestNet

### Purpose

This process defines the standard voting duration and effectivity timelines for MainNet, DevNet, and TestNet proposals, including those that have already been approved by SV rights owners.


### Status

This is a draft process based on current working practices and prior meeting resolutions. No fully formal process yet exists.

### Process

#### 1. Voting Duration

- **MainNet**:  
  - Standard proposal expiration is **1 week (5 business days)**.  
  - Applies to all proposals, including CIPs already approved by SV rights owners (e.g., CIP-0044, CIP-0039, CIP-0035).  
  - No additional SV rights owner approval is required prior to operator voting.

- **DevNet and TestNet**:  
  - Standard proposal expiration is also **1 week (5 business days)** unless explicitly agreed otherwise for specific operational needs.

#### 2. Effectivity

- The effectivity date should be **at least one full day after expiration** to allow time for preparation and coordination before changes take effect.

#### 3. Special Cases

- Proposals that are purely operational and already have SV rights owner approval still follow the same **5 business day** voting period before implementation.

### Notes

- This process ensures adequate review time while maintaining consistency across MainNet, DevNet, and TestNet.
- Shortened voting periods require explicit agreement among SV operators and should be considered exceptions, not the norm.
