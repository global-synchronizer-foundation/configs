## Performing On-Chain Votes

### Purpose

This process defines the required steps for Super Validator (SV) operators to create, announce, and manage on-chain vote proposals in alignment with governance requirements.

### Status

This is a draft process based on current practices and agreements from SV operator discussions.

### Process

#### 1. Prepare the Proposal

- Draft the vote proposal in accordance with applicable governance requirements (e.g., CIP or tokenomics processes).
- Ensure the proposal includes:
  - A **link** to the relevant **CIP vote announcement** or **tokenomics announcement**.
  - All necessary operational and technical details for SV review.

#### 2. Initiate the On-Chain Vote

- Use the SV UI or the corresponding SV app API to open the on-chain vote.
- Confirm that the vote description clearly references the related CIP or tokenomics proposal.

#### 3. Announce the Vote

- Send an email to the **`supervalidator-announce@lists.sync.global`** channel immediately after initiating the vote.
- The announcement must include:
  - A **link** back to the on-chain vote proposal **or** the **contract ID** of the vote.
  - A **link** to the CIP or tokenomics announcement.
  - Any additional relevant context.

#### 4. Approval Before Announcement

- The vote announcement **must** be approved by the **lead SV operator** for the proposing organization before it is sent.

#### 5. Record and Follow Up

- Maintain a record of:
  - The on-chain vote proposal link or contract ID.
  - The related CIP/tokenomics announcement link.
  - The date and time of the email announcement.
- Monitor the vote until it closes, and take any required follow-up actions based on the results.

### Notes

- This process applies to all on-chain votes initiated by SV operators.
- Consistent announcement formatting helps ensure clarity for all SV
